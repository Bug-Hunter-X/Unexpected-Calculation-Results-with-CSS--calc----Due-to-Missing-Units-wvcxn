The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you try to use `calc()` with a unitless value, it might lead to unexpected results. For example, consider this code snippet:
```css
.element { width: calc(50% - 10); }
```
In this case, the `10` is treated as pixels, not a percentage, which leads to an incorrect calculation. The correct approach would be:
```css
.element { width: calc(50% - 10px); }
```
